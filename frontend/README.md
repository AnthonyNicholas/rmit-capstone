# rmit-capstone
Capstone project with Empower Wealth.

## RMIT Project Description
Fintech is a fast moving and growing industry and open banking is coming to Australian Banks this year.  Money SMARTS is proprietary personal money management system developed by Empower Wealth. As an extension to its base functionality – the next phase Money SMART will incorporate a feed of the user’s expenditure to keep track automatically their budget. The project will involve the team investigating the new open banking API available or existing data extraction vendors as a solution. The aim is to develop capture, mapping and tracking software to integrate a proposed solution into Money SMARTS outlining how this can be done in the most effective and cost-efficient manner.

## Desired Outcomes

1) Vendor review of the best available solution, including a comparison to an in-house build with open banking API.

2) Proposed interface to money SMART including system cycle i.e. batch runs, down time etc., pseudo code of proposed end-points

3) Proposal for a UI design (expectation is that this should be minimal given it is an interface project).
